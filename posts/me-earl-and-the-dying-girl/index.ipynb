    "Me, and Earl, and the Dying girl, is a story about Greg Gaines — a high school kid who makes movie parodies with his work partner Earl — as he’s forced to console a girl named Rachel, who has just been diagnosed with Leukemia. Rachel rebukes him at first, but she soon goes along with it after seeing Greg’s funny side, in a rather humorous conversation they have, on how she should treat people who ask her stupid questions. This is where Greg, unfortunately, falls in love with her."

    "Greg’s stubborn refusal to fit in to any of his cliques at school, spoke volumes of my own childhood. Instead of befriending people, I spoke less to them, and during college, I was pretty much like him. My intentions were the same in both cases, and the similarity to Greg’s situation, uncanny. He/I did it in order to spare himself/myself the heartbreak of rejection, and his/my self-hating tendencies that were built up, aggravated that feeling. We had experienced the same things growing up, albeit at a slightly slower pace. I really can’t say that I’m better off now, but I’ve learnt to acknowledge those experiences and my feelings much more."

There was a possibility of romance, but nothing cropped up; again stating how this film didn’t pander to anyone. I can’t really say any more about the film. It is now, one of my fondest memories."

So far, I’ve just worked on a stick comic on how colors could be interpreted differently depending on the subject. I might post about this later. And a prose on a crush I once had. Soon after, I struggled to put my pen to paper. Brief as it was, it meant so much to me. This movie made me want to start that again for some reason."

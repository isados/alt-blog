    "text": "I loved it. Every moment of it. To my mind, only a few words were lodged in my head as I watched the film, which were poignant enough to set the tone for the ride I was about to experience.\nPausing for a bit; this is the first review I’d read in the top right corner of the Google search on the film.\n\nThe beauty of “Me and Earl and the Dying Girl” — and it truly is a beautiful film, both visually and emotionally — is that it doesn’t pander to anyone.\n\n\n- S. Jhoanna Robledo, Common Sense Media\n\nThe story is honest and pure; two qualities I admire the most in the world. I strive towards them and even as I write this article, I struggle to meet them. What I’m writing is less of a review, and more of a deep dive into my own subconscious. So let’s dive in.\nMe, and Earl, and the Dying girl, is a story about Greg Gaines — a high school kid who makes movie parodies with his work partner Earl — as he’s forced to console a girl named Rachel, who has just been diagnosed with Leukemia. Rachel rebukes him at first, but she soon goes along with it after seeing Greg’s funny side, in a rather humorous conversation they have, on how she should treat people who ask her stupid questions. This is where Greg, unfortunately, falls in love with her.\nWhat begins after that is a wonderful tale of their daily meetups and hangouts, and eventually how they finally get closer. Greg’s emotional fences, start to crumble down and he gradually shows his truer self. A self that he was never comfortable to reveal.\nGreg’s stubborn refusal to fit in to any of his cliques at school, spoke volumes of my own childhood. Instead of befriending people, I spoke less to them, and during college, I was pretty much like him. My intentions were the same in both cases, and the similarity to Greg’s situation, uncanny. He/I did it in order to spare himself/myself the heartbreak of rejection, and his/my self-hating tendencies that were built up, aggravated that feeling. We had experienced the same things growing up, albeit at a slightly slower pace. I really can’t say that I’m better off now, but I’ve learnt to acknowledge those experiences and my feelings much more.\nThe movie was filled with beautiful scenes from their homemade films, and what was especially noteworthy was the montage of Rachel attempting to watch each (and every) one of their movies. A film about making bad films, and one of the characters loves it!\nThe plot was simple, and their lives even simpler, yet it made me delighted and happier. And by the end of it, heartbroken.\nPerhaps, it was those touching scenes when they huddled together, all comfy and relaxed, watching one flick after another, that the film really portrayed how innocent and simple it all was. There was a possibility of romance, but nothing cropped up; again stating how this film didn’t pander to anyone. I can’t really say any more about the film. It is now, one of my fondest memories.\nAfter it was over, I felt a strong sense that I needed to write about it. Almost as if, it rekindled that short and brief moment when I loved writing. So far, I’ve just worked on a stick comic on how colors could be interpreted differently depending on the subject. I might post about this later. And a prose on a crush I once had. Soon after, I struggled to put my pen to paper. Brief as it was, it meant so much to me. This movie made me want to start that again for some reason.\nPerhaps, it was Greg’s life as a filmmaker that echoed my own yearnings in life. To make something from nothing; to manufacture a whole world out of sheer joy of seeing it come to life. Where anything was possible…\nIf you’d actually watched the film, you’d probably think it didn’t deserve this much praise, and for lack of a better word, that I lack taste. However, knowing how it made me feel in a tumultuous time in my life, I still think my perspective holds. Hope it makes you feel the same way."

I want to study certain areas in Bahrain and the kind of restaurants that surround them.\nI think that a lot of people, not just the youth could benefit from this, since the issue isn’t just finding a decent place to stay in Bahrain, but finding one that best serves their culinary interests perhaps.\nI mean there are obviously much better factors to look at besides food. However for this problem I want to stick to what I can gain from Foursquare with a free license. Thus, by neatly categorizing areas based on their attributes such as frequency of coffee shops, closeness to malls etc; I can can make a better guesstimate of where they might stay.\nFoursquare allows us to grab information on venues surrounding a given location, and therefore we will look into the most frequent kind of venues surrounding a given area, and cluster areas them on that.\nSo let’s get started!"

We will use the bh_grouped dataframe since it contains the necessary numerical values for machine learning.\nOur feature set is comprised of all the food categories (10 features).\nWe are excluding the NumberOfFoodPlaces feature as input to the ML model, since our problem requires segmenting areas by the type of food available. This quantity is only relevant to us to finally decide whether to live in an area or not.\nA more concrete reason to exclude it, is the fact that there are all sorts of factors involved that we’re neglecting due to lack of data, such as living costs, access to public transport etc.\nThis is a foodie’s guide to finding a place, and this venture shouldn’t be bogged-down by the fact that there are sometimes fewer number of restaurants than one would expect.\nOur target value will be cluster labels.\nFor our machine learning analysis, we will use the simplest clustering algorithm to separate the areas which is K-Means Clustering; an unsupervised machine learning approach to serve our purpose. We’ll use the popular machine learning library Sci-Kit Learn to do that in python.\nWe’ll run k-means to group the areas into 5 clusters. We pick this number for the sake of examination. We’ll fit the model on the entire data to learn these clusters.\n\n# set number of clusters\nkclusters = 5\n\nbh_grouped_clustering = bh_grouped.drop(['Area','NumberOfFoodPlaces'], 1)\n\n# run k-means clustering\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=kclusters, random_state=0).fit(bh_grouped_clustering)\n\n# check cluster labels generated for each row in the dataframe\nkmeans.labels_[0:10] \n\narray([1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], dtype=int32)\n\n\nLet’s create a new dataframe bh_merged that includes the cluster as well as the top 10 food places for each area.\n\n# add clustering labels\ntry:\n    foods_sorted.insert(0, 'Cluster Labels', kmeans.labels_)\nexcept:\n    # Allows me to retry if the Cluster Labels column exists\n    foods_sorted['Cluster Labels'] = kmeans.labels_\n\nbh_merged = bh_data\n\n# merge bh_grouped with bh_data to add latitude/longitude for each neighborhood\nbh_merged = bh_merged.join(foods_sorted.set_index('Area'), on='Area')\nbh_merged.dropna(how='any', axis=0, inplace=True)\nbh_merged['Cluster Labels'] = bh_merged['Cluster Labels'].astype(np.int32)\nbh_merged.head() # check the last columns!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArea\nLatitude\nLongitude\nCluster Labels\nNumberOfFoodPlaces\n1st Most Common Food Place\n2nd Most Common Food Place\n3rd Most Common Food Place\n4th Most Common Food Place\n5th Most Common Food Place\n6th Most Common Food Place\n7th Most Common Food Place\n8th Most Common Food Place\n9th Most Common Food Place\n10th Most Common Food Place\n\n\n\n\n0\nA'ali\n26.154454\n50.527364\n1\n19.0\nCafé\nRestaurant\nCoffee Shop\nCupcake Shop\nBreakfast Spot\nFood\nSandwich Place\nFalafel Restaurant\nMiddle Eastern Restaurant\nBakery\n\n\n1\nAbu Baham\n26.205737\n50.541668\n0\n9.0\nMiddle Eastern Restaurant\nCafeteria\nIce Cream Shop\nDonut Shop\nBBQ Joint\nRestaurant\nFish & Chips Shop\nMediterranean Restaurant\nAfghan Restaurant\nNew American Restaurant\n\n\n3\nAl Garrya\n26.232690\n50.578110\n0\n50.0\nRestaurant\nBreakfast Spot\nIndian Restaurant\nCoffee Shop\nFilipino Restaurant\nCafé\nFried Chicken Joint\nFast Food Restaurant\nDiner\nMiddle Eastern Restaurant\n\n\n4\nAl Hajar\n26.225405\n50.590138\n0\n49.0\nCafé\nFilipino Restaurant\nMiddle Eastern Restaurant\nFast Food Restaurant\nCoffee Shop\nAsian Restaurant\nIndian Restaurant\nPizza Place\nBBQ Joint\nRestaurant\n\n\n5\nAl Kharijiya\n26.160230\n50.609140\n0\n16.0\nCafeteria\nAsian Restaurant\nFast Food Restaurant\nBakery\nWings Joint\nPizza Place\nFalafel Restaurant\nMiddle Eastern Restaurant\nCafé\nFood Court\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s visualize the resulting clusters\n\n\nMake this Notebook Trusted to load map: File -&gt; Trust Notebook"

We’re done with finding our clusters, and finding out which areas fall into it. To understand the constraints and my discussion to conclude this solution, please refer to my report available on my github repo, where you will find the datasets I’ve used :D\nI hope you’ve enjoyed reading & learning something new from this post. Doing this was part of my data-science course, and I hope you can do the same with your hobby projects.\nUntil next time, cheers!"
